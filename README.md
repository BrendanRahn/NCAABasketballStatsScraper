Uses Python 3.10.2

TODO:
- Containerize repo with Docker, use Poetry to manage python packages
- Set up scraper for Stathead webpages


Setup:
- Because there is no containerization or package manager, you will have to install individual Python packages for your environment
- Code makes a connection to a Postgres server hosted on your local machine, connection string parameters will have to be put into an .env file in the root directory
